# Pattern Recognition for Customer Behavior Analysis  
*A Study Using the UCI Online Retail II Dataset*

This project uses the UCI Online Retail II dataset to explore how pattern recognition (PR) methods behave when grouping and classifying customer behavior. By building features, reducing dimensions, visualizing the data, and analyzing errors, this study evaluates how well different models explain the structure of the data and how useful they are in practice.
